## formula for questions

## `sin2x`

```
sin2x = 2sinxcosx

cos2x = cos²x - sin²x

```

## `formula for i is calculated`

```
the power of i is divided by 4
if it is completely divided by four, the value of i^n = 1
if remainder is 1 , then the value of i^n is  i
if remainder is 2 , then the value of i^n is  -1
if remainder is 3 , then the value of i^n is  -i
```

## `sum of an infinite gp`

```
sum of infinite gp = a/(1-r) where a = first term and r is the common ratio

if r ≥ 1, then the sum tends to infinity
```

## `number of subsets`

```
number of subsets = 2^n where, n is the number of elements in that set
```

## `distance between a point and a line`

```
d = |Ax1 + By1 + C| /root (A² + B²)
```

## `what is the complement of a set`

```
The set that includes all the elements of the universal set that are not present in the given set
```

## `Demorgen's law`

```
(A ∪ B)'= A'∩ B'
(A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'
```

## `formula for conjugate and modulus`

```
modulus : root(a² + b²)

conjugate : a - ib 			where a and b are real numbers,
								  and i is iota
```

## `mean of two geometric progressions`

```
root (a * b)
```
